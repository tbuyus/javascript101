# About

Javascript 101 is a [CodeHub Bristol](https://www.meetup.com/CodeHub-Bristol/) meet up group that meets up every other Tuesday at 10am - 1pm at the [Beatroot cafe](http://www.beatrootcafe.com/) in Bristol, UK.

The main intention is to support and encourage each other in learning industry best practices in full-stack Javascript development; having a space reserved that is dedicated to learning JS. We might prepare [little talks](https://javascript101.gitbooks.io/guide/content/presentations.html), but it is not primarily about teaching, rather self-directed learning.

## Mission Statement

> A collaborative learning environment for learning Javascript best practises to industry standard.

## Format

The major part of each session should be coding. We suggest certain topics \(so far we have done the coding challenges in [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)\), but you can just as well bring your own project to work on; you can also work through [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) or similar. If you get stuck with any of these, feel free to ask others for help.

We have some time before and after the coding session where people can present something they are working on.

We have also had "whiteboard sessions" where we have talked about programming concepts, for example different ways to declare a function. Sessions are optional, you don't have to sit through a talk if you aren't interested. You might want to go onto another table and pair program for example.

### General **Agenda**

**10:00** - Intros & Last Meeting Follow-up \(15 min\).

* Short 30 sec - 1 min intro from everyone \(if new members in group\). Just 2 points: what stage of learning you're at and what you've been working on since the last meetup. New people can then get a grasp of what everyone is working on and who to direct questions to

**10:15** - Session 1 \(30 min\)

* Demo/presentation/discussion topic

15 min break for overruns/questions/drinks/setup for next session

**11:00 **- Session 2 \(30 min\)

* Demo/presentation/discussion topic

* If nothing planned, go directly into coding

15 min break for overruns/questions/drinks/setup for next session

**11:45** - Coding \(75 min\)

* Focus on pair coding, either the team apps or individual apps

* Use our [Git Kanban](https://github.com/orgs/CodeHubOrg/projects) for organising team app tasks

**13:00** - Recap & next weekâ€™s topics \(5 min\)

* Next week's agenda suggestions added directly to the [Meetup Topics/Suggestions Git Kanban](https://github.com/orgs/CodeHubOrg/projects/4)

## Is this group for me?

Is it for you? That's difficult to tell in advance, of course. We would say there is an emphasis on JavaScript as a programming language, not so much moving quickly to libraries like [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) to achieve all kinds of effects.

All skill levels are welcome!

[Bristol JS](https://www.meetup.com/BristolJS/) is another great meet up group that holds talks and a social in the pub afterwards.

[Simple Web](https://www.meetup.com/simpleweb/) holds hack nights from time to time.
