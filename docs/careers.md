# Careers

Our group is great for either getting into a web development career or for progressing your existing career. We use current industry standard software (mostly open source) and techniques and work together collaboratively using Git in exactly the same way as is used in a work-based commercial environment.

## Some of the technologies and tools we use when working on projects together:

- Javascript including ES6
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Node
- Express
- React
- NPM
- Webpack
- Git
- Linux
- Mac

## Resources

We have members from all levels of experience, from complete beginners to very experienced web development 'lifers'. All are welcoming and happy to help and share knowledge with the group.

Members regularly share information and resources they have used for learning Javascript and related technologies

## Are you recruiting?
Our members are often on the lookout for new job or freelance opportunities. Please get in touch with us and we will probably be able to put you in touch with several members.
